# XBlast - Bomberman Like Game

Programmation project for first year Java course at EPFL.

Inspired from XBlast (very similar to the well known game Bomberman), it allows for up to 4 players to play together online and on different computer through connecting to one server, host by one of the player or else.

The players can perform basic actions that are sent to the server which compute the gamestate at every tick. The actions consist of moving N/S/E/W or place a bomb. We added some special features such as portals and new colored graphics (initially the game was in black and white).
